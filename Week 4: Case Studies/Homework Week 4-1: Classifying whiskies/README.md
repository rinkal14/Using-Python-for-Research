# Homework Week 4-1: Classifying whiskies

In this homework, a classification of scotch whiskies is done on the basis of their flavor characteristics. Basically, I have explored correlations of the data, plotted a correlations matrix, used spectral co-clustering algorithm for clustering the whiskies based on their flavor profiles and then compared the correlation matrices. Also, in this homework, I have plotted some interactive plots using bokeh library.
