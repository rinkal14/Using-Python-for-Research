# Classifying Whiskies
In this case study, a classification of scotch whiskies is done on the basis of their flavor characteristics. Basically, I have explored correlations of the data, plotted a correlations matrix, used spectral co-clustering algorithm for clustering the whiskies based on their  flavor profiles and then compared the correlation matrices.
