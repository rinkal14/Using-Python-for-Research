# KNN Classifier

The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems. In this case study, a KNN classifier is created and tested on some random synthetic data and also few graphs are plotted to analysis the performance. The performance of the home-made KNN classifier is compared to the Scikit learn's KNN classifier.
