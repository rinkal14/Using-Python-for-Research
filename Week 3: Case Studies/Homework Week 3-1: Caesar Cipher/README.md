# Homework Week 3-1 : Caesar Cipher

A cipher is a secret code for a language. This homework includes a cipher that is reported by contemporary Greek historians to have been used by Julius Caesar to send secret messages to generals during times of war. The Caesar cipher shifts each letter of a message to another letter in the alphabet located at fixed distance from the original letter. If the encryption key is 1, h is shifter to the next letter i, i to the next letter j, and so on. If we reach the end of the alphabet, which in this case is the space character, it simply loop back to a. To decode the message, similar shift is performed but in backward direction, so the same number of steps backwards in the alphabet.
