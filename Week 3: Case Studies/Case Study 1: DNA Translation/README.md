# DNA Translation

DNA is a discrete code physically present in almost every cell of an living organism. DNA is a one dimensional string of characters with four characters to choose from. These characters are A, C, G and T. They stands for the first letter with four neucleotides used to construct DNA. The full form of these neucleotides are adenine, cytosine, guanine and thymine. Each unique three characters of sequence of nucleotides, sometimes called a nucleotide triplet, corresponds to one amino acid. The sequence of amino acids is unique for each type of protein and all proteins are built from the same set of just 20 amino acids for all living things. Instructions in the DNA are first transcribed into RNA and the RNA is then translated into proteins. We can think of DNA, when read as sequences of three letters, as a dictionary of life. In this case study, we will write a code to translate the DNA sequence to a sequence of amino acids where each amino acid is represented by a unique letter. We will also check our generated amino acid sequence with the original amino acid sequence. The data files are downloaded from the [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NM_207618.2). The dictionary is provided as [table.py](https://github.com/rinkal14/Using-Python-for-Research/blob/master/Week%203:%20Case%20Studies/Case%20Study%201:%20DNA%20Translation/table.py) file inside the repository.
